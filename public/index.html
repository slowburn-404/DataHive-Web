                    1.2 Usage Data: We may collect information about how you use the App, including your data usage
                    statistics,

                <h2 class="py-2 font-semibold">Use of Information</h2>
                <p>
                    2.1 We use the collected information to provide and improve the App's functionality, personalize your
                    experience,
                    and analyze usage patterns to optimize our services.<br>

                    2.2 We may use your personal information to send you notifications, updates, and promotional
                    communications
                    related to the App, unless you opt out of such communications.</p>

                <h2 class="py-2 font-semibold">Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
                <p>
                    3.1 We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. However, we may share
                    your
                    information with trusted service providers who assist us in operating the App and delivering our
                    services,
                    subject
                    to strict confidentiality obligations.<br>

                    3.2 We may disclose your personal information if required by law or in good faith belief that such
                    action is
                    necessary to comply with legal obligations, protect our rights or the rights of others, or investigate
                    fraud
                    or
                    security issues.</p>

                <h2 class="py-2 font-semibold">Data Security</h2>
                <p>
                    4.1 We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or
                    disclosure.
                    However, no data transmission over the internet or electronic storage method is 100% secure, and we
                    cannot
                    guarantee absolute security.</p>

                    without
                    parental consent, please contact us, and we will take steps to remove such information.</p>

                    modifications
                    constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2 class="py-2 font-semibold">User Account and Permissions</h2>
                <p>

                    Gmail
                    account
                    for authentication purposes. By doing so, you grant the DataHive App access to your Google or Gmail
                    account
                    information.<br>
                    1.3. The DataHive App may request certain permissions on your mobile device to access and collect data
                    usage

                    or completeness of the data displayed in the DataHive App. You acknowledge that the data displayed may
                    vary

                    2.3. The DataHive App uses various algorithms and methods to calculate and present data usage
                    statistics.
                    These
                    methods may not be precise and may differ from the calculations used by your service provider or device
                    operating
                    system.</p>
